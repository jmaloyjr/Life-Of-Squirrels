# Life of Squirrels

We are CTRL-ALT-ELITE. The members of this team are Erin Oâ€™Connor, Dan Paddock, Charlie Hannum, Jack Maloy, and Nishant Chintala. 

Our project is a game that involves the user as a squirrel trying to climb up a tree. On the screen will be two separate, parallel trees. The user will use the right and left arrow keys to switch between the trees. On the trees, obstacles and power-ups will randomly appear. The user will use the arrow keys to avoid obstacles and collect power-ups. The longer the user stays alive, the higher the score. The game gets faster and more obstacles will appear as the user continues to stay alive. The user also has the option to customize the squirrel based on the number of acorns they collect.

We intend to implement the project using HTML, CSS, and Javascript, including Bootstrap and JQuery. The code layout will be as follows: the basic structure will be in HTML, the design and customization will be in CSS, and the logic of the game will be in JavaScript. The general design guidelines include smooth animations, a working game, and user-friendliness.

We plan to work collaboratively on this project. With that said, each of us brings a skillset with various languages and will focus on tasks centered around that. Nish brings a CSS background and will also help with implementing power-ups. Erin brings an HTML background and will also help with customizing different aspects of the game. Jack brings an HTML background as well, and will also help with Javascript elements like the scene/moving animations. Charlie will help to focus on creating some of the obstacles that the users will face during the gameplay. Dan will focus on the score mechanics of the game along with the logic around the collisions that the user will face.
